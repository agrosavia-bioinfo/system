01 :
Reaction coordinate: Q and RG used folding. Poor choices for some proteins because may change the structure and one measure grow and the other decrease

02 :
Reaction Coordinate Q: problems

03 :
Reaction Coordinate RMSD: problems

04 :
Multi-Dim Reaction Coordinate Justification: only one properte will be insufficient

05 :
Order parameter as a property space containing 32 properties in a one-dimensional reaction coordinate.

06 :
Reaction Coordinate Final Discussion: applied to any protein, compensates deficiences between separated properties.

07 :
Reaction Coordintat: description of computer time consum.
